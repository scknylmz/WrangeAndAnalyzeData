    "WRANGLE REPORT\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tIntroduction\n",
    "This report is about the process of organizing and cleaning data as part of the Wrangle and Analyze Data project. The data we're working with is a collection of tweets from a Twitter user called @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs and adds funny comments about them. We need to go through the following steps to organize the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tDefinition\n",
    "Data wrangling is a crucial step in the data analysis pipeline as it helps ensure that the data is accurate, complete, and ready for analysis. It requires a combination of technical skills, domain knowledge, and critical thinking to effectively handle the challenges associated with real-world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Wrangling process is divided into three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Gathering. \n",
    "• Assessing. \n",
    "• Cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tGathering Data\n",
    "Data was gathered from three different sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "a.\tThe data we used for this project is a collection of tweets from the WeRateDogs Twitter account. We got this data from Udacity in a file format called CSV (“twitter-archive-enhanced.csv”). We used a tool called Pandas to read the data from the file and store it in a structured format called a DataFrame. We named this DataFrame “df_arc”.\n",
    "\n",
    "b.\tWe also downloaded another file programmatically using a library called Requests. This file is in a format called TSV and contains image predictions. Udacity provided us with a URL to download this file. We used the 'get' method from the Requests library to download the file and then used Pandas to read the content and store it in a DataFrame called “df_img”.\n",
    "\n",
    "c.\tIn order to get more data from Twitter as an alternative, we used the open function to read row by row and translate into pandas dataframe and store it in a DataFrame called “df_tweet”.\n",
    "4.\tAssessing Data\n",
    "The data we collect is often not in the formats we need or want. Once we gathered the necessary data, I discovered the following problems with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "a.\tQuality Issue for twitter_archive_enhanced\n",
    "Quality\n",
    "Visual Method\n",
    "1. Invalid names or \"None\" names (Column: name)\n",
    "Programmatic\n",
    "2. Invalid ratings, Max rate should be 10 not 1776 (Column: rating_numerator)\n",
    "3. Invalid denominator, I expected fixed 10. (Column: rating_denominator)\n",
    "4. Convert to date format. (Column: timestamp)\n",
    "5. It is similar to zip code, it must be a string. (Column: tweet_id)\n",
    "6. Same dog retweeted so it can be dublicated records. (Column: retweeted_status_id)\n",
    "7. Same dog replied so it can be dublicated records. (Column: in_reply_to_status_id)\n",
    "\n",
    "     Tidiness\n",
    "Visual Method\n",
    "8. HTML tags, URL, and content in a single column.\n",
    "Programmatic\n",
    "9. Categorical variable translate into one column as shown drug example shown in Udacity. (Column: doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo)\n",
    "10. There is two information in a single column. It should be two column as text and URL. (Column: text)\n",
    "\n",
    "b.\tQuality Issue for image_predictions.tsv\n",
    "Quality\n",
    "Visual Method\n",
    "11. Dog's breed is not standard, Capital Letter Issue. (Column: p1, p2, p3)\n",
    "Programmatic\n",
    "12. ID must be string. (Column: tweet_id)\n",
    "13. There is dublicated entries which are belongs to retweet or replies. (Column: jpg_url)\n",
    "14. Merging these two tables (df_arc, df_twitter and df_img) into one. (Table: twitter_master)\n",
    "15. My Suggestion: If there is any False prediction image is not relevent to dog. If all predictions are True, image is relevent to dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "c.\tQuality Issue for tweet-json.json\n",
    "Quality\n",
    "Programmatic\n",
    "16. ID must be string. (Column: tweet_id)\n",
    "5.\tCleaning Data\n",
    "I used my knowledge of Python and searched online, like Google, Stack Overflow for help and guidance to solve the problems I mentioned earlier. I had to try different approaches and experiment with regular expressions for more complex cases. However, some tasks, like removing unnecessary columns, were relatively easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, I gained a lot of knowledge about using Python effectively and efficiently to clean and store data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dog’s names issue was solved evaluating if it starts with a capital letter it was a name if not it was an ordinary word and I have converted to “None”. Most of the issues involving non-usual values to rating_numerator and rating_denominator were solved as Denomiator should be constant and max nominator should be equal to max denomiator to reach higest rate 1.00.\n",
    "\n",
    "In regard to the duplicated information, I decided to remove all retweets and reply to avoid double entries of the same dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I have solved the tidiness issues combining the tables twitter_archive_enhanced.csv, image_predictions.tsv and tweet-json in one called twitter_archive_master.csv. I have also merged 4 columns (doggo, pupper, puppo, and floofer) into one, which I have bundled and named as dogtionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most challange was cleaning of image prediction table. Because the predictions are not exact information. Therefore, to use these data for insisghts were not easy as shared on dataframe.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data was prepared, I analyzed it using visualizations, as documented in the act_report.pdf file.\n",
    "\n"
